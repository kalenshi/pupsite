A Quick journey into flask web development

This little project started out as just answering a question about CRUD in flask.
I just continued adding features to it and thought i should just put it out there for anyone to critisize 
so that i should be making continuous chnages to it. You can follow along or code along if you want to.
the site is being hosted [here @ kalenshi.info](https://www.kalenshi.info/)
I will continue to make improvements on it as time allows and soon, there will be a suggestion form.
Feel free to fork and improve.
